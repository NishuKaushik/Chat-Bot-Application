Welcome to the Chatbot Application project. This web-based application provides a simple and interactive chat interface designed for engaging conversations. The core of the project includes an HTML file (index.html) which sets up the chat layout, a CSS file (style.css) for styling, and a JavaScript file (script.js) to manage the chat functionalities.

The HTML file structures the page with a chat container where messages are displayed, an input field for users to type their messages, and a send button adorned with a Telegram icon from Font Awesome. The design is visually enhanced using the Poppins font from Google Fonts and additional styling in the style.css file.

To get started with the project, clone the repository if it is hosted on a version control system. Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your web browser. This will allow you to view and interact with the chat interface.

The project relies on Google Fonts for typography and Font Awesome for iconography. Future enhancements might include integrating a backend for real-time chat interactions, improving the user interface with more advanced styling, and adding features like message history and user authentication.
